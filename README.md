# Audiophilia

## Abstract
A sample e-commerce site with which users shop for high-end home audio equipment.

## Technologies
- **Framework**: React / NextJS
- **Static Analysis**: TypeScript
- **Data Fetching & State Management**: Apollo Client
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Test-Driven Development**: Mock Service Worker, Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- **Code Hygiene**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky
- **Wireframing**: Figma

## Goals
- Build to a set of comps using Figma
  - Rather than coming up with my own project spec, I elected to get wireframes from an an existing spec to simulate the workflow of collaborating with a product design team, and to get some additional practice working with detailed Figma files.
- Learn NextJS
  - I'd previously been building SPAs with client side rendering and wanted to start building front-ends with SSR, for its benefits with speed and SEO.
- Learn Mock Service Worker, Jest, React Testing Library
  - Having used Mocha/Chai for unit testing and Cypress for E2E testing on previous projects, I wanted to expand on my mocking and testing strategies, especially when working on applications for which a backend is not already built.
- Build a GraphQL API
  - Since I'd previously built REST APIs in Node and worked with GraphQL on the front end in other projects, I wanted to get a taste of working with GraphQL on the back end as well.
